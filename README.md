This project involves building a machine learning model to predict mobile phone prices based on various features such as processor, RAM, memory, battery, camera specifications, and more. The goal is to identify the most significant features that impact pricing and provide actionable insights for optimizing pricing strategies.
Key Steps in the Project:
Data Exploration: Loaded and explored the dataset to understand the structure, types, and distributions of the data.
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and converted the price column to a numerical format.
Feature Extraction: Performed correlation analysis and feature selection to identify the most relevant features.
Model Building: Developed and trained a predictive model using machine learning algorithms (Random Forest).
Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
Feature Importance Analysis: Analyzed and visualized the most influential features affecting mobile phone prices.
Recommendations: Provided strategic insights for pricing and marketing decisions based on the analysis.
Results:
Identified key features such as processor, RAM, and camera that significantly affect mobile phone prices.
Developed a predictive model with good accuracy in predicting mobile phone prices.
